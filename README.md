# InverseOptimizationBasedPreferenceEstimation
The source codes in the article “Estimation of Schedule Preference and Crowding Perception in Urban Rail Corridor Commuting: An Inverse Optimization Method”

1. Inverse optimization based estimation:
   The codes include the sensitivity-based solution method for homogenous commuters in Section 5.2.1, the sensitivity-based solution method for multi-class commuters in Section 5.2.2, and the refined norm-relaxed method of feasible directions algorithm presented in Appendix B. The input data necessary for replication are provided in the same file in CSV format.
   
2. Discrete choice estimation:
   The codes include estimation procedures from econometric models of discrete choice detailed in Section 5.1, Appendix E, and Appendix F, utilizing the PandasBiogeme package. The input data necessary for replication are provided in the same file in CSV format.
