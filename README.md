# InverseOptimizationBasedPreferenceEstimation
The source codes in the article “Estimation of Schedule Preference and Crowding Perception in Urban Rail Corridor Commuting: An Inverse Optimization Method”
1. Inverse optimization based estimation
   The codes include the sensitivity-based solution method under rail commuting corridor with homogenous commuters in Section 5.2.1, the sensitivity-based solution method under rail commuting corridor with multi-class commuters in Section 5.2.1 and the refined norm-relaxed method of feasible directions algorithm in Appendix B. The input data for replication are presented in the same file as CSV format.
